# DigitGAN
## The Model
This GAN generates images of handwritten numbers (numbers zero through nine) based on an MNIST dataset containing images of numberes written by people. The model contains two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator The discriminator is trained on the dataset and fake samples convolutional neural networks classify whether or not a skin sample possesses monkeypox based on an image of the skin sample. The models will predict a value close to 0 if the sample is predicted to be of monkeypox and a 1 if the sample is not predicted to be monkeypox. Since all of the models predict binary categorical values, each uses a binary crossentropy loss function and has 1 output neuron. They use standard SGD and Adam optimizers with a learning rate of 0.001 and have dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
